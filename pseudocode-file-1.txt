Input / Output: 

*I will be creating an input/ output function using R studio. I plan to plot the diversity of my group though time. I will be using this link to help me achieve my goal: 

http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/library/geoscale/html/geoscalePlot.html

*Possible pseudocodes to achieve my goal in creating basic plots:

data(traits)
attach(traits)

1. A simple bivariant plot

Pseudocode:
project_plot = plot age versus plot trait
 geoscalePlot(age,trait)


2. Including the entire time scale

  Pseudocode:
project_plot = geoscalePlot(age,trait,units=c("Eon","Era","Age","Epoch","Period"),type="l")
